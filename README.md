# AdamGreen.Tech ESLint Config
The purpose of this ESLint config is to achieve a highly opinionated code formatting
standard that prioritises:

- Ease of readability
- Maximising immutability
- Using functional driven approaches
- Using later ECMAScript features such as `async/await`
- Providing Production and Staging standards
